# Reduction-of-array
In this program i have implemented the c++ code that solve the problem define below
Problem: You have given an array of size N. You have to reduce an array by putting values 0 to n - 1 such that the values get assigned base on non decreasing nature of original array.
Ex. if array is 10 16 7 14 5 3 12 9, so you have to reduce an array such that the if we look for non decreasing nature the the smallest is 3, so assign 0 to 3, then next is 5,
so assign 1 to 5, do it til n - 1, i.e. last element will be 16, so assign 7 to 16.
Our output will look like this.
Output: 4 7 2 6 1 0 5 3
